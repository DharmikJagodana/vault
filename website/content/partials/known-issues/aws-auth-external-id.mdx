### AWS Auth Role configuration requires an external_id

#### Affected Versions

- 1.17.0 - 1.17.3

#### Issue

You must set the `external_id` parameter during role configuration, or the Vault
AWS authentication plugin returns a validation error.

#### Workaround

Configure the backend with an external_id set (if external ids are not being used, supplying any string longer than two
characters will work). Then, configure any desired roles. After this is done, the external id can be removed.
